<h2>About the Developers</h2>
<p>Keyboard Warrior was developed by four enthusiastic programmers - Owaise, Fahad, Chandra Sekhar, and Sahil - as part of a 48-hour hackathon project. We came up with the idea for this game because we wanted to create a fun and engaging way for people to improve their typing skills.
Our team has put a lot of effort into making this game as enjoyable as possible for our users. We’ve designed it to be intuitive and user-friendly, with sleek graphics and smooth gameplay so everyone can have fun playing our game. We’re proud of what we’ve accomplished in such a short amount of time.
We hope that our typing game will help people improve their typing skills while also having fun. So why not give it a try and see how fast you can type? Thank you for visiting our website, and we hope you enjoy playing our game!</p>
